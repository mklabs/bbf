      <p>
        Super simplified version of a Form Generator from Backbone.Models with the bare minimum functionnality I need.
        Actually, this is just a simple form html generation from given model attributes. The resulting html is designed to fit well with bootstrap's form layout.
      </p>
      <p>This is still a Backbone.View, so it's expected that it should work in very much the same way.</p>

      <p class="alert-message warning"><em>
        I've made this to suit very specific needs. If you're looking into a robust and mature solution to generates Forms from Backbone.Models, you should definitely take a look at the really neat <a href="http://github.com/powmedia/backbone-forms">backbone-form</a>. It'll go far beyond what this bbf thing is able to do, and it'll do in a much better way.

          <p>
            Forms views are given a model to work with on which the View will operate and
            generate the form's html. It'll use a template function that can be overriden
            by passing in a precompiled template function property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forms are able to generate text inputs, select lists, textareas and checkboxes.

          <h2>Nested objects</h2>
          <p>
            When one of the model attributes is a nested object, the html is
            recursively generated. Each id / name attributes are created based on
            the current key and optional nested level key, taking the form of
            <code>input-viewid-nested-key</code> where <code>viewid</code>
            refers to the Backbone View's cid property.

          <h2>Extending Backbone.Form</h2>
          <p>
            A Backbone.Form can be created and used right away, but they're still Backbone.View. So,
            it's expected that they should behave in very much the same way
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, we could create a custom Backbone.View extending from Backbone.Form
            and still be able to use properties like <code>events</code>, <code>tagName</code> or <code>className</code>.
            In addition to that, the custom <code>template</code> property could be used to pass in a precompiled
            template function to utterly customize the form output.

            <h2>What about form validation?</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            I'd recommend putting the validation logic into your models, not inside the views, even if it is
            a form view. the <code>serialize</code> method is meant to return an object that is suitable to use with
            models' <code>set</code> method, regardless the nested object structure and "levels".
          </p>
          <p>
            Optionnaly, the forms may (or may not) listen for <code>error</code> events on the provided model
            and provides some defaults error handling (such as displaying the error message in an <code>.error</code> box)
          </p>


          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>What about data-binding?</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Not yet implemented, but hopefully, we'll get there. The basic idea is that whenever one of the
            fields' value changes, the according model attributes is udpated (and vice-versa). The change will probably happen with
            <code>{ silent: true }</code> by default, but that'll certainly need to be configurable through options.
