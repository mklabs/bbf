# bbf

Generates forms from Backbone.Model attributes.

Generated html should fit well with twitter bootstrap's forms layout, and templates
precompiled function could be passed in to completely customize the form
output.

**disclaimer:** I've made this to suit very specific need at work and
decided to push it here upstream. If you're looking into a robust and
mature solution to generates Forms from Backbone.Models, you should
definitely take a look at the really neat
[powmedia/backbone-forms](https://github.com/powmedia/backbone-forms).
It'll go far beyond what this bbf thing is able to do, and it'll do in a
far far better way.

That beeing said, if you'd like to check out some more examples, you may
want to take a look at this [example
page](https://mklabs.github.com/bbf/examples/), see the [annotated source
code](https://mklabs.github.com/bbf/docs/bbf.html), or run
the [tests](https://mklabs.github.com/bbf/tests/).
